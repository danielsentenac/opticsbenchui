    <h1>Camera Configuration</h1>
    <p>
    At the present OpticsBenchUI works with three types of cameras:
     <li>Firewire cameras compliant with the IIDC (DCAM) standard. 
     A huge list of cameras compliant with IIDC can be found at
    <a href="http://damien.douxchamps.net/ieee1394/cameras"> Damien DouxChamps Web Site </a>. </li>
     <li>Ethernet cameras compliant with the GIGEVision standard through the use of the <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Aravis"> aravis library</a>.</li>
     <li> CameraLink Neo camera from Andor, using the SDK provided by Andor and working with BitFlow frame grabber PCIe card.</li>
    </br> 
    When starting the application, cameras plugged in the workstation will be automatically 
    added in the Instrument list in the top menu bar. In the Instruments menu, clicking on the camera 
    name triggers a separate camera window which contains the real-time video (the image frequence rate 
    depends on the resolution and workstation graphics card capabilities). It is possible from the camera 
    window to control some general features like the brightness, the gamma, the gain and the exposure time.
