    <h1>Camera Configuration</h1>
    <p>
    At the present OpticsBenchUI works with firewire cameras compliant with the IIDC (DCAM) standard. 
    A list of cameras working with OpticsBenchUI can be found at 
    <a href="http://damien.douxchamps.net/ieee1394/cameras"> Damien DouxChamps Web Site </a>.<br>
    When starting the application, all firewire cameras plugged in the workstation will be automatically 
    added in the Instrument list in the top menu bar. In the Instruments menu, clicking on the camera 
    name triggers a separate camera window which contains the real-time video (the image frequence rate 
    depends on the resolution and workstation graphics card capabilities). It is possible from the camera 
    window to control some general features like the brightness, the gamma, the gain and the exposure time.
