    <h1>Acquisition Configuration</h1>
    <p>
      The Acquisition window allows the user to program a Scan and save data in a user-specific way.

    <TABLE BORDER="1">
      <CAPTION> <b> Acquisition sequence </b></CAPTION>
	<TR>
	  <TD> record </TD>
	  <TD> This is a unique value given by the user defining the sequence order in the scan. 
	    The scan will be treated in ascending order </TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
	  <TD> type </TD>
	  <TD> The type of sequence. Can take one of the following name:<br>
	  <li> <b>MOTOR</b>: a motor is called for a movement </li>
	  <li> <b>DAC</b>: a DAC is called for setting an output value </li>
	  <li> <b>CAMERA</b>: a camera is called for taking an image </li>
	  <li> <b>TREATMENT</b>: a calculation on existing sequence data is performed</li></TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
	  <TD> instrument </TD>
	  <TD> Here is indicated the instrument instance name from its configuration. Camera are denoted from 0 to n in order 
	    of appearance in the Instrument menu</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
	  <TD> settings </TD>
	  <TD> Here we put the information on what to do with the instrument, usually in format : [key=value] separated by one space<br>
	  <li> <b>MOTOR</b>: a motor can have MOVEREL (relative movement), MOVEABS (absolute movement) calls, 
	      with the value to be reached </li>
	  <li> <b>DAC</b>:  a DAC output is specified by OUTPUT key with the corresponding value to be set using key VALUE</li>
	  <li> <b>CAMERA</b>:  Use the SNAPSHOT key to ask an image from the camera </li>
	  <li> <b>TREATMENT</b>: Use AVG[i[-+/*]j] to perform any type of average between two taken data sequences i and j 
	      (must be of the same instrument type). For example:<br>
	  AVG[10] will result on the average value taken from record 10.</li>
	  <li><b>SLEEP</b>: A sleep in seconds to be added at the end of the sequence </li></TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
	  <TD> scanplan </TD>
	  <TD> Here we describe the scan and closely related data saving behavior, 
	    usually in format : [key=value] separated by one space<br>
	    <li> <b>LOOP</b>:  a fixed number of loop will begin when this key is present. 
	      It must be terminated with key <b>LOOP=END</b>. More than one loop can be nested</li>
	    <li> <b>DATAGROUP</b>: assign a name to a group of data. It may be used in relation with the LOOP key</li>
	  <li> <b>DATANAME</b>:  assign a name to a data element. The data is attached to the parent group in the scanplan. 
	      If it is a scalar element, the data will be attached to the parent group as an attribute. 
	      If it is an averaged data (defined in the settings box), it will be attached to the grand parent group.</li></TD>
