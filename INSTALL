                         INSTALLING OpticsBenchUI 1.1

External packages needed prior to installation:

1) Graphical user interface is based on Qt5 for Linux. 
Install it using 
git clone git://code.qt.io/qt/qt5.git
   Qt 5 note: ensure the Qt SVG development package is installed so qmake can
   find the `svg` module. On Fedora this is typically `qt5-qtsvg-devel`
   (the runtime package alone does not provide the module `.pri` file).

2) Firewire Camera compliant with DCAM (IIDC) standard is based on libdc1394
http://damien.douxchamps.net/ieee1394/libdc1394/

3) Advantech boards are controlled via the advdaq library
http://support.advantech.com.tw/support/

4) Comedi boards controlled using the comedi library
http://www.comedi.org

5) HDF5 data library to manage data collection
http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/

OpticsBenchUI is compiled within the Qt5 framework, using a requirement file called
OpticsBenchUI.pro. First you need to update OpticsBenchUI.pro according to 
libdc1394,advdaq,comedi,hdf5 libraries and modify it with your personal path installations (INCLUDEPATH, LIBS tags)

OpticsBenchUI installation steps:

In the source directory (where is present the OpticsBenchUI.pro file):

1) qmake
   - Qt 5: qmake-qt5 OpticsBenchUI.pro
   - Qt 6: qmake6 OpticsBenchUI.pro

2) make

This will create an OpticsBenchUI executable

Optional dependencies (HDF5, OpenGL headers, Qt Multimedia, Standa, USB, Qt SVG)
are detected at build time and disabled if missing.

3) Set/Update the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable with the library paths of 
libdc1394,advdaq,comedi,hdf5 libraries 

4) Launch OpticsBenchUI ! There is a documentation accessible from the GUI which 
will help you to configure the devices.
