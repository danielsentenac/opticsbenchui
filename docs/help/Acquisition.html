    <h1>Acquisition Configuration</h1>
    <p>
      The Acquisition window allows the user to program a scan and save data in a user-defined way.

    <table border="1">
      <caption><b>Acquisition sequence</b></caption>
      <tr>
        <td>record</td>
        <td>
          This is a unique value given by the user defining the sequence order in the scan.
          The scan is processed in ascending order.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>type</td>
        <td>
          The type of sequence. Supported values include:
          <ul>
            <li><b>MOTOR</b>: a motor is called for a movement</li>
            <li><b>SUPERK</b>: a supercontinuum laser is called for filter settings</li>
            <li><b>DAC</b>: a DAC is called for setting an output value</li>
            <li><b>CAMERA</b>: a camera is called for taking an image</li>
            <li><b>TREATMENT</b>: a calculation on existing sequence data is performed</li>
            <li><b>FILE</b>: an external file is parsed to use its data</li>
            <li><b>SLM</b>: a spatial light modulator (secondary screen) is used with a registered mask list</li>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>instrument</td>
        <td>
          The instrument instance name from its configuration. Cameras are numbered from 0 to n
          in order of appearance in the Instrument menu.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>settings</td>
        <td>
          Instrument actions, usually in format [key=value] separated by spaces.
          <ul>
            <li><b>MOTOR</b>: MOVEREL (relative movement) or MOVEABS (absolute movement) with the target value</li>
            <li>
              <b>SUPERK</b>: (R)POWER (power level), (R)ND (output level), (R)SWP (short wavelength setpoint),
              (R)LWP (long wavelength setpoint) with absolute or relative values
            </li>
            <li><b>DAC</b>: OUTPUT key with VALUE (absolute) or RVALUE (relative) for the output value</li>
            <li>
              <b>CAMERA</b>: SNAPSHOT for Mono 8-bit; SNAPSHOT32 for Mono 12-bit, Mono 12-bit packed, or Mono 16-bit
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>TREATMENT</b>:
              AVG=[i[-+/*]j] performs arithmetic between two sequence records i and j (same instrument type).
              Example: AVG[10] uses the average value from record 10.
              PHASE=[i,j] computes phase from imaginary i and real j.
              AMPLITUDE=[i,j] computes amplitude from imaginary i and real j.
              IMAGE=[i] converts a 2D array dataset to an 8-bit pixel image.
            </li>
            <li><b>FILE</b>: see File section.</li>
            <li><b>SLM</b>: see SLM section.</li>
            <li><b>ANALYSIS=START</b>: trigger the Analysis task list</li>
            <li><b>SLEEP</b>: delay (seconds) added at the end of the sequence</li>

              <b>LOOP</b>: a fixed number of loops begin when this key is present and must be terminated with

            </li>
            <li>
              <b>LOOPMODE</b>: defines loop traversal behavior. Use <b>LOOPMODE=SNAKE</b> for
              a serpentine scan (alternate direction each loop pass).

            <li><b>DATAGROUP</b>: assign a name to a group of data, often used with LOOP.</li>
            <li>
              <b>DATANAME</b>: assign a name to a data element. Scalar data is attached to the parent group
              as an attribute. Averaged data (defined in the settings box) is attached to the grandparent group.
