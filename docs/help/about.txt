OpticsBenchUI is dedicated to automating optics lab experiments. It integrates
open-source projects such as libdc1394, Aravis, and Comedi to coordinate
heterogeneous hardware from a single interface. Each instrument can be
configured and operated independently, and complex multi-instrument scans are
programmed in the Acquisition window. Device availability depends on build
options and installed vendor SDKs.

Supported devices include digital cameras (FireWire/DCAM, GigE Vision,
Camera Link), actuators (RS-232, USB, Ethernet), spatial light modulators (SLM),
digital and analog I/O (counters, DAC, ADC), and Supercontinuum laser sources
(CP210X USB-UART bridge). Data are stored in a hierarchical, scan-aware layout
using HDF5. The GUI is built with Qt.

Motivation
----------
Optics bench experiments typically require software for two complementary tasks:
1) Individual device control and acquisition for manual alignment and setup.
2) Coordinated, automated workflows where multiple devices must interact during
   scans or control loops.

Commercial frameworks can address point 2), but they often become difficult to
extend as experiments grow. An open-source approach provides long-term
flexibility, transparent behavior, and easier reuse of software components.

OpticsBenchUI embraces open-source principles: it is modifiable, hardware-agnostic,
and benefits from a broad ecosystem of libraries and vendor SDKs. This makes it
a practical bridge between academic research and industrial workflows.

The documentation in this folder describes how to configure each device
class and how scan sequences are defined. Measurements are saved in HDF5
format for downstream analysis.

External libraries (OpticsBenchUI.pro) are optional and will disable related
features when missing.

Analysis tasks:
Analysis sequences are configured in analysis.db3 (table: analysis_sequence).
Use the Analysis panel to define command-line tasks (code path + arguments).
Add ANALYSE=START in acquisition settings to auto-run the analysis list.
