OpticsBenchUI is a Qt-based control application for optical experiments.
It connects to common lab hardware (cameras, motors, DAC/Comedi boards,
laser sources, and SLMs), and lets you build scan sequences from the
Acquisition window. Device availability depends on build options and
installed vendor SDKs.

The documentation in this folder describes how to configure each device
class and how scan sequences are defined. Measurements are saved in HDF5
format for downstream analysis.
